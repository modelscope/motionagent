# Introduction

如果您熟悉中文，可以阅读[中文版本的README](./README_ZH.md)。

MotionAgent is a deep learning model tool that can generate videos from user-created scripts. Users can create scripts, generate movie stills, generate images/videos, and compose background music through our provided toolset.

The model of MotionAgent is powered by the open-source model community [ModelScope](https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope).


# Features
- Script Generation
  - Users can generate scripts by specifying the story theme and background
  - The script generation model is based on LLM (such as Qwen-7B-Chat), which can generate scripts of various styles
- Movie still Generation
  - Generate corresponding movie still scene images 
- Video Generation
  - Generate videos from images
  - Support high-resolution video generation
- Music Generation
  - Custom style background music



# Quick Start

## Compatibility Verification
Verified environments:
- python3.8
- torch2.0.1
- CUDA11.7
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Nvidia-A100 40G


## Resource Requirements
- GPU memory: 36GB
- Disk: It is recommended to reserve more than 50GB of storage space


## Installation Guide

### conda virtual environment

Use the conda virtual environment, refer to [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to manage your dependencies, after installation, execute the following commands:

```shell
conda create -n motion_agent python=3.8
conda activate motion_agent

GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/modelscope/motionagent.git --depth 1
cd motionagent

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python3 app.py

# Note: MotionAgent currently supports single-card GPU, if your environment has multiple cards, please use the following command
# CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 app.py
# Note: If you are using the Modelscope community Notebook or if your disk memory is less than 100GB, please turn on the clear_cache switch. Each run will result in re-downloading the model, causing a significant decrease in speed. Please be patient and wait.
# python3 app.py --clear_cache

# Finally, click on the URL generated in the log to access the page.
